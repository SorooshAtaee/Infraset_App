InfraSet: Automated Infrastructure LCA MappingInfraSet is a computational tool designed to bridge the gap between 3D modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). By integrating directly into the Rhino and Grasshopper environments, it allows designers to receive real-time feedback on the environmental impact of their infrastructure assemblies.🚀 Environment SetupThis project is built to run within the Rhino 7/8 ecosystem. No external Python installation is required as it utilizes Rhino's internal Python interpreters.PrerequisitesRhino 7 or 8Grasshopper (built-in to Rhino)GHPython component (standard in modern Grasshopper)🛠 How to Run the Scripts1. Backend: Data & Logic RegistryThe backend file (Backend_InfraSet.py) contains the material database and core calculation logic. It should be initialized within Rhino's Python editor.Open Rhino.Type EditPythonScript in the command line and press Enter.In the editor window, go to File > Open and select Backend_InfraSet.py.Press the Play button (or F5) to initialize the database and verify the logic.2. Frontend: Grasshopper IntegrationThe frontend files (e.g., Frontend_element_InfraSet.py) are designed to be used as scripts inside Grasshopper components to visualize data and interact with geometry.Open Grasshopper within Rhino.Drag a Python Script component onto the canvas.Right-click the component and select Edit....Paste the content of the relevant Frontend script into the editor.Connect your Rhino geometry or material parameters to the component inputs.The component will output real-time LCA metrics (GHG, Energy, Water) based on your model changes.📁 Repository StructureBackend_InfraSet.py: The "Source of Truth" containing material coefficients and assembly logic.Frontend_Infrastructure_InfraSet.py: Handles high-level infrastructure visualization.Frontend_element_InfraSet.py: Individual component-level analysis (Piers, Abutments, etc.).Result_InfraSet.py: Logic for formatting and exporting assessment results.INFRASET.pptx: Technical presentation and architectural overview.📝 This workflow is designed to support Information Management by ensuring that BIM data remains linked to environmental metadata throughout the design lifecycle. By running these scripts in the Rhino/Grasshopper environment, users can perform rapid iterations without manual data reentry into external LCA software.Contact:Soroosh Ataee - soroosh.ataee@uclouvain.be
